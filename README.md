# SIRTOS

SIRTOS is a Simple Real Time Operating System project for educational purposes.

The system provides soft real-time capabilities to serve real time processes and data and meet deadlines. The main contribution of this paper is a very simple open source operating system that implements different real-time algorithms. The code is kept minimal as the kernel is only 15000 lines long. It supports high definition graphics and easy modification which allows more real-time algorithms to be implemented.
