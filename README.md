# SIRTOS

<b>SIRTOS</b> is a Simple Real Time Operating System.<br>
This project was made for educational purposes.

<i>The system provides soft real-time capabilities to serve real time processes and data and meet deadlines. The purpose of this project is a very simple open source operating system that implements different real-time algorithms. The code is kept minimal as the kernel is only 15000 lines long. It supports high definition graphics and easy modification which allows more real-time algorithms to be implemented.</i>
